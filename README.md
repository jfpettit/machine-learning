This repository will contain my machine learning projects and details about each one.

## [hidden-markov-model](https://github.com/jfpettit/machine-learning/tree/master/hidden-markov-model)
The hidden-markov-model repository contains a Python and NumPy based implementation of a Hidden Markov Model. It contains a Viterbi algorithm, Baum-Welch, forward and backward passes, and the other necessary parts of a Hidden Markov Model. The code was developed in a course project with [Nathaniel Leonard](https://github.com/NateAnthonyLeonard).
