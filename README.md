# machine-learning
This repository will contain my machine learning projects and details about each one.

## [hidden-markov-model](https://github.com/jfpettit/machine-learning/tree/master/hidden-markov-model)
The hidden-markov-model folder contains a Python and NumPy based implementation of a Hidden Markov Model. It contains a Viterbi algorithm, Baum-Welch, forward and backward passes, and the other necessary parts of a Hidden Markov Model. The code was developed in a course project with [Nathaniel Leonard](https://github.com/NateAnthonyLeonard).

## [data](https://github.com/jfpettit/machine-learning/tree/master/data)
The data folder will contain all of the data needed for any examples in this repository. Plain and simple.

## [multiclass-logreg](https://github.com/jfpettit/machine-learning/tree/master/multiclass-logreg)
The multiclass-logreg folder contains a Python and Numpy based implementation of a multiclass logistic regression, and it makes use of [Feature Selection with Annealing (FSA)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.2880.pdf) to reduce the number of model parameters as training progresses.
