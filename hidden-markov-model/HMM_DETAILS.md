# Hidden Markov Model

### This work was done by Jacob Pettit and [Nathaniel Leonard](https://github.com/NateAnthonyLeonard)

The work here was done as a part of Applied Machine Learning (STA 5635) at FSU.

See the hidden_markov_model.py file for just the code we used to implement the model. See the hidden_markov_demo.ipynb file
for a short demonstration of how we used the code to solve a simple problem.
